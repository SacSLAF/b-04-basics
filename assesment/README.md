1. Three states of a Promise:

pending: initial state, not yet fulfilled or rejected.

fulfilled: operation completed successfully.

rejected: operation failed.

2. Effect of async keyword:
It makes the function always return a Promise, even if you return a normal value.

3. Purpose of await:
It pauses the async function until the Promise is resolved or rejected.

4. A function passed as an argument to be run after an operation (like setTimeout) is finished.

5. It handles the execution of multiple operations by queuing callbacks and running them after the current task is done.
